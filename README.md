## Installation

To install the current version use the code below to install from
GitHub. The use of “force = TRUE” ensures the package is installed even
if already present. If the package `remotes` is missing the code below
will install it.

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){install.packages("remotes")}  #install if needed
install_github("Blocktt/AKDECtools", force=TRUE)
```
A [vignette](https://github.com/Blocktt/AKDECtools/blob/main/vignettes/AKDECtools.Rmd) has been created as a guide to the package functions. The vignette can be installed with the package to be viewed within the R environment using the code below.

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){install.packages("remotes")}  #install if needed
install_github("Blocktt/AKDECtools", force=TRUE, build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

## Purpose

AKDECtools provides various functions that support water quality
analyses frequently undertaken by the AK DEC’s [Water Quality Monitoring
and Assessment
Program](https://dec.alaska.gov/water/water-quality/monitoring-and-assessment/).
