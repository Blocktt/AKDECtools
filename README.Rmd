## Installation

To install the current version use the code below to install from GitHub. The use of “force = TRUE” ensures the package is installed even if already present. If the package `remotes` is missing the code below will install it.

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){install.packages("remotes")}  #install if needed
install_github("Blocktt/AKDECtools", force=TRUE)
```
The vignette (big help file) isn’t created when installing from GitHub with the basic `install_github` command. If you want the vignette install with the code below.

```r
if(!require(remotes)){install.packages("remotes")}  #install if needed
install_github("Blocktt/AKDECtools", force=TRUE, build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

## Purpose
AKDECtools provides various functions that support water quality analyses frequently undertaken by the AK DEC's [Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Program](https://dec.alaska.gov/water/water-quality/monitoring-and-assessment/).

## Status

In development.
